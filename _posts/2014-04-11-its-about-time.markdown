I finally have a site of my own. I've been meaning to do this for the past year or so. The final kick I needed turned out to be [one game a month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) which I've just started. My first game for 1GAM is [Ping](/projects/Ping), a hopefully interesting variation on Pong. Because I'm going to be making so many games I need a place to host (and show them off) from, and that's what this site is for.

Not yet sure how much I'll be using this blog though. I'll probably use it for at least major project progress updates.
