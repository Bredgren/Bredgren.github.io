Hello there and welcome to my website! I'm using this site as a blog and as a place to display all my neat games and other projects.

My name is Brandon Edgren. I'll be graduating in June with degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington. Then I'll be starting a Software Engineering position at [Arista Networks](http://www.aristanetworks.com/).

My primary hobbies are making/playing games, rock climbing, and piano. I've been making games pretty much ever since I started learning programming in 2009. School and other things made it very difficult for me to actually complete most of my projects however. But things have changed and I plan to be much better about it. I got into rock climbing sometime around 2005 and it's the only sport I truly enjoy doing. Almost all of my climbing is indoors because it's not the adventure that appeals most to me, it's the physical and mental challenge of the climbing itself, and climbing indoors is much more convenient. I'm mostly self-taught at the piano so I'm really not that great, but since I've started practicing regularly I've been improving rapidly.
