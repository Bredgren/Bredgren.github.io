Ping is my first game for [one game a month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) and is for the month of April 2014. It's based off of Pong but with some extra physics elements. The paddles may be rotated in a manor similar to the paddles of a pinball machine but with the pivot in the center. The ball is capable of spinning which makes the ball interact with the paddles differently as well as causing curved trajectories. The player's goal, if they choose to take it, will be to do well enough to unlock different types of balls (different shapes and/or properties) which each provide a slightly different experience. Instead of just keeping score and stopping after a limit is reached, there is a time limit and the winner is whoever has the most points at the end. Different balls may then be unlocked upon scoreing a certain number of points against a certain opponent in a single match, or simply after scoreing a certain total number of points over all games. The possible opponents are human, normal AI, or hard AI.
