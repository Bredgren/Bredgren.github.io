This is my game for the month of May 2014 for one game a month. This was not my orginal plan for this month though. I had started ZeroDegreeC and was making decent progress, but kept hitting snags with HaxelFlixel because this was the first time I'd used it. Being busy with school didn't help either. I got down to the last week and realized I needed a new plan. I came up with something super simple and only expanded slightly to help make it more ineresting. I think it turned out pretty good for less than 5 days of work, HaxeFlixel is quite amazing when you start getting used to it.
