This is a little Java game I made in a week. I wanted to do something with particles so I made a really general system that let me define just about any sort of behavior I wanted. But because of how quickly I put it together, it really sucked to work with and so I decided to stop where I was. The only real fancy particle effects are the shields and the explosions, which where the two main effects I had in mind from the start.

There is a good chance that I will revive this project for one game a month. If I do then I'll start over and do it better, and in something other than Java.
